# DESCRIPTION: Garz & Fricke fwrite endurance test
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# This test sequence writes 50,000 files with 1 kBytes, split
# into 50 steps with 1,000 files each, on an SD-Card. This is
# approx. 50 MBytes in total. The SD-Card has to be mounted in
# /mnt/mmc. The whole test takes about 1.5 hours.
