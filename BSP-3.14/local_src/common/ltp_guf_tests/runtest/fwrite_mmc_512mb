# DESCRIPTION: Garz & Fricke fwrite endurance test
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This test sequence writes files from 100 Bytes to 1MBytes (10x each),
# 10 MBytes (15x) and 100 MBytes (3x) on an SD-Card. This is approx. 462 MBytes
# in total and takes about 2 minutes (if the card runs at 5 MB/s). You can
# copy and paste the following lines a few times to run them more than once.
# The SD-Card has to be mounted in /mnt/mmc.
