# DESCRIPTION: Garz & Fricke fwrite endurance test
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This test sequence writes files from 100 Bytes to 100 MBytes (10x each),
# 1 GBytes (2x) and 2 GBytes (2x) on an SD-Card. This is approx. 7.1 GBytes
# in total and takes about 25 minutes (if the card runs at 5 MB/s). You can
# copy and paste the following lines a few times to run them more than once.
# The SD-Card has to be mounted in /mnt/mmc.
