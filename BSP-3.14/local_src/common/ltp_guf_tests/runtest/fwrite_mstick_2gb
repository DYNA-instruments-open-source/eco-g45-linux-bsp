# DESCRIPTION: Garz & Fricke fwrite endurance test
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This test sequence writes files from 100 Bytes to 10 MBytes (10x each),
# 100 MBytes (7x) and 1 GBytes (1x) on a USB drive. This is approx. 1.8 GBytes
# in total. You can copy and paste the following lines a few times to run them
# more than once. The USB drive has to be mounted in /mnt/mstick.
