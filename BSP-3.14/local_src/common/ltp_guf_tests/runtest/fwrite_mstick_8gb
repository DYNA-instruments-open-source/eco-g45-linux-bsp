# DESCRIPTION: Garz & Fricke fwrite endurance test
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This test sequence writes files from 100 Bytes to 100 MBytes (10x each),
# 1 GBytes (2x) and 2 GBytes (2x) on a USB drive. This is approx. 7.1 GBytes
# in total. You can copy and paste the following lines a few times to run
# them more than once. The USB drive has to be mounted in /mnt/mstick.
